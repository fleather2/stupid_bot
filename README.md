# stupid_bot
Bot which emails the recipients the Stupid Deal of the Day from musiciansfriend.com.

This simple program is written in Python and uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a webpage and uses a gmail bot to send a hidden list of recipients some information from that page.

In order for the program to work properly, a list of email recipients must be added in the project folder as "recipients.txt."
